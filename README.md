# Discussion_forum

Discussion Forum is a non-graphical, entirely text-based forum application developed in Java. This project serves as a guide for building many of the functionalities you may find on online discussion platforms, such as UpGrad's class forum. Key features include user registration and login, creating and upvoting questions, replying to questions, upvoting replies, listing all replies to a question, and deleting questions and their replies.

## Features:

User Management: Register and log into user accounts to participate in discussions.

Question Handling: Create and upvote questions to facilitate discussions.

Reply System: Engage in conversations by replying to questions, upvoting replies, and listing all replies to a question.

Content Management: Delete questions and their associated replies.

It provides insights into object-oriented programming concepts and serves as an educational resource for those looking to develop similar text-based applications.
